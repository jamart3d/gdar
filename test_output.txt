══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY FLUTTER TEST FRAMEWORK ╞════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown running a test:
Tried to use Provider with a subtype of Listenable/Stream (AudioProvider).

This is likely a mistake, as Provider will not automatically update dependents
when AudioProvider is updated. Instead, consider changing Provider for more specific
implementation that handles the update mechanism, such as:

- ListenableProvider
- ChangeNotifierProvider
- ValueListenableProvider
- StreamProvider

Alternatively, if you are making your own provider, consider using InheritedProvider.

If you think that this is not an error, you can disable this check by setting
Provider.debugCheckInvalidValueType to `null` in your main file:

```
void main() {
  Provider.debugCheckInvalidValueType = null;

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```


When the exception was thrown, this was the stack:
