# gdar - To-Do List

This file tracks planned features, enhancements, and bug fixes for the gdar application.

## High Priority
- [x] **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for providers (`AudioProvider`, `ShowListProvider`) to ensure business logic is correct.
- [x] **Widget Tests:** Write widget tests for critical UI components like `ShowListCard` and `PlaybackScreen`.
- [x] **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling for audio playback (e.g., show a snackbar if a track URL is invalid or network fails).
- [ ] **Bug Investigation:** Check into why RGB border is not visible on Android 16 vs 15.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] **Search Filtering:** Add filter chips to the search experience (e.g., filter by year).

- [ ] **UI Polish:** Refine animations and transitions for an even smoother feel.

- [ ] **Accessibility:** Review the app for accessibility improvements (e.g., screen reader labels).

## Low Priority / Ideas
- [ ] **Favorites:** Allow users to mark certain shows as "favorites" for quick access.
