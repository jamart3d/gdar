# gdar - To-Do List

This file tracks planned features, enhancements, and bug fixes for the gdar application.

## High Priority
- [x] **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for providers (`AudioProvider`, `ShowListProvider`) to ensure business logic is correct.
- [x] **Widget Tests:** Write widget tests for critical UI components like `ShowListCard` and `PlaybackScreen`.
- [x] **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling for audio playback (e.g., show a snackbar if a track URL is invalid or network fails).

## Medium Priority
- [ ] **Search Filtering:** Add filter chips to the search experience (e.g., filter by year).
- [ ] **Search icon indicator toggle:** toggle indicator visble state , tied to search box
- [ ] **UI Polish:** Refine animations and transitions for an even smoother feel.
- [ ] **"Now Playing" Indicator:** Add a more prominent "Now Playing" indicator (like an animated equalizer icon) to the currently playing show/track in the main list.
- [ ] **Accessibility:** Review the app for accessibility improvements (e.g., screen reader labels).

## Low Priority / Ideas
- [ ] **Favorites:** Allow users to mark certain shows as "favorites" for quick access.
