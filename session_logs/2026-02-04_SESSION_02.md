# 2026-02-04 Session 02

## Hypotheses
- The codebase contains leftover boilerplate comments from Flutter templates.
- There are TODOs or FIXME comments that have already been addressed but not removed.
- Commented-out code blocks may still exist after recent refactors.

## Running Summary
- Initialized session log for codebase comment audit.
- Completed "Clinical Cleanup" of `main.dart` and standardized comments.
- Verified 100% test success (121/121).
- Prepared GA Release 1.0.29 (Updated `pubspec.yaml` and `RELEASE_NOTES.txt`).
- Initiated signed Android App Bundle build.

## Bug Tracker
- N/A

## Handoff
- Current System State: Project is GA-ready and building the release artifact (1.0.29+29). Final step is git push.
