# Session Log: Playback Panel Overflow Investigation

## Context
User reports an overflow in the open sliding panel on the playback screen when using "Caveat" font with UI scaling enabled.

## Hypotheses
- The text size for Caveat with scaling might be exceeding the available vertical or horizontal space in the panel header or content.
- `SlidingUpPanel` or its inner content might not be scrollable or have `Flexible`/`Expanded` widgets correctly placed.
- Specific widgets like "Venue" or Track Title might be the culprits.

## Plan
1. Explore `lib/ui/screens/playback_screen.dart` and relevant widgets.
2. Identify where Caveat font is applied and how scaling acts on it.
3. specific focus on the "Venue" text area as mentioned in previous context (gaps above venue).
