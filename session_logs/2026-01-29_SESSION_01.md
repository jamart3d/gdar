### Hypotheses:
- Wrapping the rating bar and dice in `FittedBox(fit: BoxFit.scaleDown)` inside a `SizedBox` will prevent horizontal overflow on small screens while allowing them to grow with UI Scale.

### Running Summary:
- Researching current scaling of `RatingDialog` and `AnimatedDiceIcon`.
- [x] Standardized `RatingControl` scaling logic using `AppTypography.responsiveFontSize`.
- [x] Updated `RatingDialog` to scale stars and use `FittedBox` for small screen safety.
- [x] Implemented UI scaling for `AnimatedDiceIcon` in the AppBar.
- [x] Cleaned up manual scaling from all `RatingControl` callers (`ShowListCard`, `SourceListItem`, `RatedShowsScreen`, `PlaybackAppBar`, `PlaybackPanel`).
- [x] Verified changes with `show_list_card_test.dart` (All passed).

### Bug Tracker
- Resolved: Duplicate scale multiplier issue (double-scaling) across various widgets by centralizing scaling logic in `RatingControl`.

### Handoff
Responsive scaling for Rating UI and Dice Icon is complete and standardized.
