## Hypotheses
- The "swipe to block" and "undo" functionality in `ShowListScreen` might have been broken or removed during recent refactoring of `ShowListScreen` into `ShowListShell` and `ShowListBody`.
- The `Dismissible` widget or its background/onDismissed handlers might be missing or incorrectly implemented.

## Running Summary
- Initialized session log.
- Investigating `ShowListScreen` for "swipe to block" and "undo" feature regression.
- Searching for relevant keywords ("undo", "block", "swipe", "Dismissible").

## Bug Tracker
- N/A

## Handoff
- Current System State: Researching the implementation of show blocking in the show list.
