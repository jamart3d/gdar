# Session Log: 2026-01-05

## Summary
- **Refactored Settings Interace**: Reordered the `Interface` section in `SettingsScreen` into logical groups (General, Date/Time, Lists, Tracks).
- **Track List Improvements**:
  - Replaced the stacking `SnackBar` warning for "Play on Tap disabled" with a `Contextual Overlay`.
  - The overlay appears directly on top of the tapped track item.
  - Fixed a crash (`RenderSliverList` TypeError) by wrapping list items in a `Builder` to ensure correct context for `findRenderObject`.
  - Increased bottom padding of the track list (40.0 default, 160.0 with mini-player) to improve scrolling and visibility.
- **Encore Logic Updates**:
  - Implemented `report_messy_tracks`.
  - Added alias support and logic for "Final Blessing" / "Soft Landing" roles.
  - Removed SHNID 71.

## Current System State
- **App Status**: Running (Hot Restarted).
- **Pending**:
  - Verify ADB connection stability (currently active via `flutter run`).
  - User may have further UI tweaks.

## Handoff
- The `track_list_screen.dart` has been modified to use `OverlayEntry`.
- `settings_screen.dart` has improved organization.
- `audit_json.py` logic is robust.
