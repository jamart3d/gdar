## Hypotheses
- Android 15 (SDK 35) migration requires `enableEdgeToEdge()` in Kotlin and proper inset handling in Flutter.
- Picture-in-Picture for audio can be implemented via `PictureInPictureParams` in `MainActivity.kt`.

## Running Summary
- Initialized Task List for Android 15 Migration.
- Researched `build.gradle.kts` and `MainActivity.kt`.
- Performed deep audit of `lib/main.dart`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, and `mapping.txt`.
- **Discovery**: Play Console Issue #2 traces to Flutter's internal engine.
- **Implementation (Phase 1)**: User manually completed native/UI setup for edge-to-edge. Mandatory Android 15 UI Restoration is **Complete**.
- **Implementation (Phase 2)**: User manually enabled manifest support for PiP. Remainder of Phase 2 is **Postponed**.
- Updated `task.md` and `implementation_plan.md` to reflect status.

## Bug Tracker
- None.

## Handoff
- Android 15 Edge-to-Edge (Phase 1) is fully implemented.
- Audio PiP (Phase 2) is postponed after initial manifest setup.
- App is ready for testing on API 35.
