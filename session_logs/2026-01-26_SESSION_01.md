# Session Log: 2026-01-26_SESSION_01

## Hypotheses
- User wants to remove the entry fade animation on the Splash Screen checklist.
- User queries about checklist alignment. Currently, the checklist items are individually centered, causing icons to be misaligned (zig-zag).
- Plan: Remove fade animation code. Report alignment status and offer fix (or fix if implicitly requested, but safer to ask or do a quick fix if usage implies "make it aligned").

## Running Summary
- [ ] Remove fade-in animation from `SplashScreen`.
- [ ] Analyze alignment.

## Current System State
- Splash screen has a fade-in (1.5s) and count animations.
- Checklist rows are centered.

## Handoff
-
