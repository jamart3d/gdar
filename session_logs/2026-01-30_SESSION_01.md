# 2026-01-30 Session 01 - Audit File Sizes and Refactoring Suggestions

## Hypotheses
- The app size is likely driven by the 8.8MB JSON file and unoptimized image assets.
- Large Dart files (`main.dart`, `audio_provider.dart`, `settings_provider.dart`, `track_list_screen.dart`) contain mixed responsibilities and can be refactored into smaller, more focused components.
- Unnecessary log files and test outputs in the root directory clutter the project.

## Running Summary
- Audited file sizes in root, `lib`, and `assets`.
- Identified 8.8MB JSON data file as a major contributor to size.
- Identified large icon files (1.6MB and 1.1MB PNGs).
- Identified large Dart files for potential refactoring.

## Bug Tracker
- N/A

## Handoff
- Auditing phase in progress.
