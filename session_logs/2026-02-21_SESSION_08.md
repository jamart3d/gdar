# Session Log - 2026-02-21 - SESSION_08

## Hypotheses
- Adding a feature toggle for "swipe to block" will improve UX by preventing accidental blocks, especially for users who prefer tapping or are on different form factors.
- Mock updates in tests are necessary to maintain static analysis health when extending `SettingsProvider`.

## Running Summary
- Added `enableSwipeToBlock` (default: `false`) to `DefaultSettings`.
- Extended `SettingsProvider` with state management, Hive persistence, and `toggleEnableSwipeToBlock()`.
- Added a "Gestures" section with a `SwitchListTile` to `InterfaceSection` (Phone Settings UI).
- Updated `ShowListItem` and `ShowListItemDetails` to conditionally set `DismissDirection` based on the new toggle.
- Resolved static analysis errors in `playback_screen_tv_test.dart` and `tv_regression_test.dart` by updating `FakeSettingsProvider`.
- Added a unit test in `settings_provider_test.dart` for the new setting.
- Verified all tests pass.

## Bug Tracker
- None.

## Handoff
- Feature "Enable Swipe to Block" is implemented and defaults to OFF. Swiping in the show list is disabled until the toggle in Settings -> Interface -> Gestures is turned ON.
