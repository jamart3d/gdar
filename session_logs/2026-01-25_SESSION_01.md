# 2026-01-25 Session 01

## Hypotheses
- Reducing font sizes on `SplashScreen` when `uiScale` is active will fix layout overflows or "too big" text collisions.
- Standardizing the scaling logic in `SplashScreen` to match `SettingsScreen` will improve UX consistency.

## Running Summary
- [x] Initialize session log.
- [x] Add TODO item to `todo.md` regarding `SplashScreen` font scaling.
- [x] Add TODO item to `todo.md` regarding `SettingsScreen` (Rock Salt) font scaling.
- [x] Add TODO item to `todo.md` regarding `PlaybackScreen` (Caveat) and sliding panel controls.
- [x] Analyze `splash_screen.dart` for current font scaling implementation.
- [x] Analyze `settings_screen.dart` for Rock Salt font scaling.
- [x] Audit `playback_screen.dart` and sliding panel for Caveat font and control sizes.
- [x] Implement font size reduction/normalization in `splash_screen.dart` when `uiScale` is ON.
- [x] Implement font size reduction for Rock Salt in `settings_screen.dart` when `uiScale` is ON.
- [x] Reduce control sizes in sliding panel (open state).
- [x] Verify fix visually (via code analysis and user walkthrough).
- [x] **Deep Link Intent Audit:** Created a detailed report of all project intents.
- [x] **Roboto Font Audit:** Reduced control sizes by ~25% for Default (Roboto) font.
- [x] **Caveat & Messages Audit:** Reduced control sizes for Caveat and optimized playback messages.
- [x] **Splash Screen Refinement:** Lowered base font size to 13.5 for scaled mode.
- [x] **Onboarding Audit:** Reduced Caveat font sizes by ~10-15% when UI Scale is ON.

## Bug Tracker
- Fixed extra brace error in `splash_screen.dart`.
- Fixed `The getter 'panelPosition' isn't defined` in `playback_controls.dart`.
- Fixed undefined `settings` variable in `onboarding_screen.dart`.

## Handoff
- Current System State: All visual scaling refinements complete (Splash, Playback, Onboarding).
- Reports: `DEEP_LINKS_REPORT.md` is at project root.
- Verification: Walkthrough updated with testing instructions.
