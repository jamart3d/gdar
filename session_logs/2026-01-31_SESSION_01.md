## Hypotheses
- The- **Release Build**: Successfully built `1.0.23+23` with the updated M3 Playback UI.
- When the `PlaybackAppBar` fades out (as the sliding panel opens), the `TrackListView` moves to the top of the screen and overlaps the status bar.
- Wrapping the `Column` containing both in a `SafeArea` should resolve this while maintaining the background color continuity.

## Running Summary
- [x] Initial research on playback safe area issue.
- [x] Identified lack of `SafeArea` in `PlaybackScreen` body when app bar is hidden.
- [x] Implemented initial fix moving `SafeArea` to `PlaybackScreen`.
- [x] Refined gap based on user feedback.
- [x] **M3 Expressive Refactor**: Switched to a layered `Stack` architecture in `PlaybackScreen`.
- [x] Enabled immersive scrolling by removing `SafeArea` and adding dynamic `topPadding` to `TrackListView`.
- [x] Resolved layout jumps by stabilizing `PlaybackAppBar` visibility logic.
- [x] **Refinement**: Tightened top gap from 12.0 to 4.0 for a more balanced appearance.
- [x] Verified build status with `dart analyze` (0 errors).

## Bug Tracker
- None.

## Handoff
- Release 1.0.22 build complete. Ready for manual upload to Google Play Console. `app-release.aab` located in `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/`.
