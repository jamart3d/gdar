# 2026-01-31 Session Audit - SESSION_01

## Hypotheses
- The dice animation likely uses a series of `Tween`s to simulate a bounce and slide.
- Single click triggers a random show selection.
- Long click may trigger a specific "background" or "deferred" random selection, or perhaps a different animation state.

## Running Summary
- Initialized session log.
- Researched `AnimatedDiceIcon` and found it uses a 10s rotation/pulsing animation with randomized faces (excluding 1).
- Verified `ShowListAppBar` single-click triggers random show selection with 10.1s delay for animation.
- Confirmed no long-click behavior on the app bar random button itself, though it exists for show cards and mini-player.

## Bug Tracker
- None.

## Handoff
- Research complete. Providing description to user.
