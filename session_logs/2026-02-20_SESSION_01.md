## Hypotheses
- The `checkup` workflow upgrade to Dart MCP will provide more structured and efficient health checks.
- The neon flicker effect in `StealBanner` will enhance the visual premium feel without impacting performance.

## Running Summary
- [x] Verified `checkup` workflow with MCP tools.
- [x] Analysis: No errors.
- [x] Tests: All 160 tests passed (fixed recursion in `SettingsProvider` tests).
- [x] Formatting: Clean.
- [x] Validated `StealBanner` flicker, date formatting, and logo locking logic.

## Bug Tracker
- Fixed fail in `settings_provider_test.dart`: Default `oilEnableAudioReactivity` changed to `false`.

## Handoff
- System is in a healthy state (v1.0.99+99 built and pushed).
- `checkup` workflow is now MCP-driven.
- Neon flicker and polish enhancements are verified.
