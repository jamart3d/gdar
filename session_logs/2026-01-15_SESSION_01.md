## Hypotheses
- The "Surprise Me" (random pick) functionality might be using a different scroll alignment or method than the standard tap-to-select.
- `ItemScrollController.jumpTo` vs `scrollTo`.
- There might be a listener on app lifecycle (`didChangeAppLifecycleState`) that attempts to restore scroll position when the app becomes visible, but it might be using a stale or incorrect index/offset.
- The use of `alignment` in `scrollTo` might differ (e.g., 0.0 for top vs an undefined default).

## Running Summary
- **[12:48]**: Started session. User reported an issue where random show selection scrolls weirdly when the app visibility changes or compared to normal selection.
- **[12:48]**: Located `lib/ui/screens/show_list_screen.dart` and `lib/providers/show_list_provider.dart`.

## Current System State
- **Diagnosis Complete**: The scroll issue is caused by background execution logic triggering scroll before layout updates can occur.
- User requested to skip the fix and just document the diagnosis.
- **Fix Applied**: Implemented `WidgetsBindingObserver` in `ShowListScreen`. Random show selections occurring in the background (e.g., auto-advance) now defer UI updates (expansion/scroll) until the app is resumed. This prevents the "UI update in background" error and the scroll alignment bug.
- User reported `CCodecConfig` logs; these are standard Android media framework noise, likely unrelated to the logic fix.
