# Session Log - 2026-02-21 - SESSION_07

## Hypotheses
- Consolidating duplicated `_formatDate` logic into `AppDateUtils` will improve maintainability and resolve naming conflicts with Flutter's `DateUtils`.

## Running Summary
- Created `AppDateUtils` in `lib/utils/app_date_utils.dart`.
- Renamed initial `DateUtils` to `AppDateUtils` to avoid conflicts.
- Refactored `Show` model to use shared utility.
- Refactored `PlaybackPanel`, `PlaybackAppBar`, `TrackListScreen`, `StealBanner`, and `CardStyleUtils` to use `AppDateUtils`.
- Verified static analysis: Clean.
- Verified tests: 155 passed, 5 failed (pre-existing regression issues).

## Bug Tracker
- Identified naming conflict with Flutter's built-in `DateUtils`. Resolved by renaming to `AppDateUtils`.
- Noted 5 test failures in `audio_provider_regression_test.dart` and `buffer_agent_test.dart` as pre-existing (based on previous conversation history).

## Handoff
- Centralized date formatting is now implemented. All identified UI components have been updated. The code is clean according to static analysis.
